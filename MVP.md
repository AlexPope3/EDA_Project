The goal of this project is to help the WTWY optimize the placement of their street team to make the most connections.

I began to explore this goal by finding the the five stations with the highest traffic defined by the sum of all daily entries and exits. 

The result provides insight as to where WTWY should deploy their street team in order to make the most contacts. The WTWY
might consider avoiding the highest traffic areas as it may be difficult to grab the attention of individuals in large crowds.
